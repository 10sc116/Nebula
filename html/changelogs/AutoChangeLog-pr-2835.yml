changes:
  - tweak: Tweaked the airlock controller UI a little bit for the advanced airlock
      controller. Makes it fit better in its window, and reorganized the buttons around
      to look a bit less messy.
  - tweak: Adjusted directional offsets for airlock devices, so they actually are
      aligned to walls.
  - tweak: Adjusted directional offsets of warning signs since they kept covering
      up airlock devices on the tradeship map.
  - bugfix: Fixed sanitizing id_tags set via multitool on the airlock machinery.
  - bugfix: Fixed airlock machinery generally falling out of sync with eachother.
  - imageadd: Added new icons for airlock sensor and airlock access button. They have
      overlays and directions now.
